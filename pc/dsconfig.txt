# Configuration File for the Drive Station
#
# Use this configuration file to customize your 
# drivestation.  The values below are an example.
#
# You should change the values to suit your robot
# and then save the result with the file name 'dsconfig.txt'.
#
# The 'dsconfig.txt' file will be read when the
# drivestation starts and the values found in
# it will be used instead of the default values
# writen in the program.
